# Project-Search
A personal first foray into GUI apps in python with an app that searches for project folders within a set parent folder. 

The goal is to develop a simple application that can be run with keyboard shortcuts to quickly open folders that are saved in a single location and are saved with a common naming convention. This is my first exploration of the tkinter library and my first "application" with python.
